Note to my self:

save machine configuration (FRAM or SD, not EEPROM)
when enough memory left in the end dump memory in config dialog
when enough memory left in the end list files on the CD card

Currently disk/memory data transfer is one byte, with 128 byte
transfers that should be much faster, but needs a 128 byte
transfer buffer in SRAM. Need to figure if that is available,
maybe use global buffer.
