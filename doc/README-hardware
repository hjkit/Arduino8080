I really have no time to draw schematics with some CAD program.
Also I think that is not necessary, the circuit is very simple and
I found lots of online documentation, how to wire such devices with
an Arduino Nano.
However, I'll leave pictures here with my breadboard setup, which should
show the wiring.

picoboard1:
Shows how the Arduino Nano is wired with an Adafruit SPI FRAM module.
Please note that I power the FRAM from the Nano stabilized 5V,
they will also work with 3.3V, just make sure you connect the
correct one to your board's power line.

picoboard2:
An Adafruit MicroSD SPI module was added, make sure you get one
that is designed for 5V, most are 3.3V.
Connect both GND pins of the Arduino Nano board to the GND rails on
your board. The MicoSD module can draw 100 mA, and all current drawn
from the 5V must flow to GND.
Then SPI runs with a clock frequency in the radio bands. And the
breadboard wiring of course makes a nice HF antenna. I have added
two capacitators with 10 uF and 100 nF between the + and - rails,
to shortcut most of the generated HF.

picoboard3:
I added a switch connected to GND and D3 at the Arduino Nano. Pressing
the switch will cause an interrupt, which stops the 8080 CPU at next M1
from whatever it is doing.
This is optional and not really required for a functioning system. If the
machine gets stuck with some broken software you can reset the Arduino
board and restart all over. It just helps to analyze problems with buggy
software.
