The directory srccpm2 includes everything needed to put a customized
CP/M 2.2 on the boot tracks of a disk image. A Makefile is included,
that assembles boot loader and CBIOS with z80pack z80asm, and also
builds the putsys utility, used to write the system onto the disk image.
This is done with two commands executed in the directory:

	make
	./putsys

With that disks/cpm22.dsk is ready to be copied to a MicroSD card into
a directory /DISKS80, which you need to create. Because I have done
this already you can just copy disks/cpm22.dsk into /DISKS80 on the
SD card.

The CP/M 2.2 disk image includes everything that came with CP/M 2.2,
plus a selection of some usefull tools. I also copied boot loader
and CBIOS sources together with submit scripts onto the disk. CP/M
was designed as self containing systems, means it has everything
like editor, assembler, loader and so on, that it can be used to
create a bootable disk. I always thought it is a good test for an
operating system, when it can build and install it self on some disk.
For this the filesystem must be stable, one needs working tools, so
everything included that you can verify this. Please be aware that
the machine is slow, this will need like 20 minutes or so, but
great fun to watch it at doing serious work.
