I really have no time to draw schematics with some CAD program.
Also I think that is not necessary, the circuit is very simple and
I found lots of online documentation, how to wire such devices with
an Arduino Nano.

However, I'll leave pictures here with my breadboard setup, which should
show the wiring. Please note that I power the FRAM from the Nano
stabilized 5V, they will also work with 3.3V, just make sure you connect
the correct one to your board's power line.

Dito the MicoSD card module, you need to get one that is designed for
5V, like the one from Adafruit I am using.

Connect both GND pins of the Arduino Nano board to the GND rails on
your board. The MicoSD module can draw 100 mA, and all current drawn
from the 5V must flow to GND.

Then SPI runs with a clock frequency in the radio bands. And the breadboard
wiring of course makes a nice HF antenna. I have added two capacitators
with 10 uF and 100 nF between the + and - rails, to shortcut most of the
generated HF.
