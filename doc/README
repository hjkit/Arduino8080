I really have no time to draw schematics with some CAD program.
Also I think that is not necessary, the circuit is very simple and
I found lots of online documentation, how to wire such devices with
an Arduino Nano.

However, I'll leave a foto here with my breadboard setup, which should
show the wiring. Please note that I power the FRAM from the Nano
stabilized 5V, they will also work with 3.3V, just make sure you connect
the correct one to your board's power line.
