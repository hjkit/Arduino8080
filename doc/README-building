You need the Arduino IDE to compile the software and upload it
into the Arduino Nano board. The software requires the following
additional libraries, which need to get installed in the IDE:

	Adafruit BusIO
	Adafruit_FRAM_SPI
	SdFat - Adafruit Fork

The Adafruit FRAM library prints debug messages to the terminal,
which needs memory. I have disabled this with #ifdef DEBUG .. #endif
in Adafruit_FRAM_SPI.cpp, a fork with the modification also is here:

	https://github.com/udo-munk/Adafruit_FRAM_SPI.git

This might be neccessary, saves over 100 bytes, during the dev process
we sometimes exceeded the boards flash memory.

Preparing a MicroSD card:
In the root directory of the card create these directories:
CONF80
CODE80
DISKS80

Into the CODE80 directory copy all the .bin files from src-examples.
Into the DISKS80 directory copy the CP/M disk image from disks.
In CONF80 create an empty text file CFG.TXT.
