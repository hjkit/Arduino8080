You need the Arduino IDE to compile the software and upload it
into the Arduino Nano board. The software requires the following
additional libraries, which need to get installed in the IDE:

	Adafruit BusIO
	Adafruit_FRAM_SPI
	SdFat - Adafruit Fork

Preparing a MicroSD card:
In the root directory of the card create these directories:
CONF80
CODE80
DISKS80

Into the CODE80 directory copy all the .bin files from src-examples.
Into the DISKS80 directory copy the CP/M disk image from disks.
In CONF80 create an empty text file CFG.TXT.

I have tried to create the configuration file from the application,
but this would pull in another 2 KB into the code segment, which we
don't have when building the Z80 variant. So the directory and an
empty file must be created once, from there on it will just be used
to save and load the last configuration.
