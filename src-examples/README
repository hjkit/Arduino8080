This directory contains 8080 code examples for the Arduino 8080.
I have assembled the sources with z80asm from z80pack, but you
can use any 8080 assembler of course. Advantage of using z80asm
is, that the latest version can output C code we can right use
here, without the need to convert from binaries or hex dumps.

Copy one of the "example".c files to ../8080code.h and rebuild
the application.

The examples are:
serial.c		- Send some text to the tty serial port and then halt CPU.
echo.c			- Echo text send to the tty serial port endless.
turnmon.c		- Very basic monitor program from "The Age Of The Altair",
			  when users had very little memory, like we now also have.
			  Read the manual if you don't know this program!
			  Don't use with Arduino IDE Serial Monitor, won't work,
			  use a terminal emulation like minicom, putty ...!
blink.c			- Blink builtin LED with 8080
