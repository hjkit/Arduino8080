This directory contains 8080 code examples for the Arduino 8080.
I have assembled the sources with z80asm from z80pack, but you
can use any 8080 assembler of course. Advantage of using z80asm
is, that the latest version can output C code we can right use
here, without the need to convert from binaries or hex dumps.

With z80pack z80sim examples like these can be debugged under
control of an In Circuit Emulator (debug probe), the serial
port implemented in the latest release is identical.

Copy one of the "example".c files to ../8080code.h and rebuild
the application.

The examples are:
serial.c	- Show how serial I/O is done.
banner.c	- Print a cool banner to the tty serial port and then halt CPU.
blink.c		- Blink builtin LED with 8080.

turnmon.c	- Very basic monitor program from "The Age Of The Altair",
		  when users had very little memory, like we now also have.
		  Read the manual if you don't know this program!
		  Don't use with Arduino IDE Serial Monitor, won't work, use
		  a terminal emulation like minicom, putty ...!
