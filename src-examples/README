This directory contains 8080 code examples for the Arduino 8080.
I have assembled the sources with z80asm from z80pack, but you
can use any 8080 assembler of course.

With z80pack z80sim examples like these can be debugged under
control of an In Circuit Emulator (debug probe), the serial
port implemented in the latest release is identical.

Copy one of the "example".bin files to your MicroSD card with the
filename /code80.bin.

The examples are:
tb.bin		- Li-Chen Wang's famous TINY BASIC for 8080.
