This directory contains 8080 code examples for the Arduino 8080.
I have assembled the sources with z80asm from z80pack, but you
can use any 8080 assembler of course.

Copy one of the "example".c files to ../8080code.h and rebuild
the application.

The examples are:
serial.c		- send some text to the tty serial port
