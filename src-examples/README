This directory contains 8080 code examples for the Arduino 8080.
I have assembled the sources with z80asm from z80pack, but you
can use any 8080 assembler of course.

With z80pack z80sim examples like these can be debugged under
control of an In Circuit Emulator (debug probe), the serial
port implemented in the latest release is identical.

On your MicroSD card create a directory with the name CODE80 and
copy the "example".bin files into it. When you run the machine
you can select which file to load, just enter the filename
without the directory and without the extension.

The examples are:
test8080.bin	- Kelly Smith 8080 CPU test program
tb.bin		- Li-Chen Wang's famous TINY BASIC for 8080.
basicex.bin	- 16 KB Microsoft BASIC for Altair 8800
